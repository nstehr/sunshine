# Sunshine
Simple Go Program to grab the Sunshine List data for Ontario and store it in a mongo db.

Actually one of the first go programs I wrote, and I updated it to support the latest sunshine list data.
The first few years of are raw HTML that need to be scraped.  The later years are in JSON, which makes things a bit nicer.
